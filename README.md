# 3. Research motivation

## 1. Background and challenges of internal projects

In my many years of practice, I had the privilege of working on an
important internal project aimed at scaling highly complex
enterprise-level solutions to a wide consumer market, and I wanted to
use this topic as a motivation for my research. However, it is not easy
to find a balance between future functional expansion and the reduction
of redundant computing operations in the future, as it needs to take
into account multiple factors such as technology, security, privacy, and
user experience. These questions will guide our research and provide a

These questions have become the core driving force of my research, and
we hope to solve these challenges through academic research and
translate the research results into practical applications.

## 2. Trigger the core questions of the research

Against this backdrop, it was not easy to realize such a large project,
and the internal project of this collaboration faced many challenges. We
face the following challenges and issues, which include but are not
limited to:

1.  Complex business processes and diverse requirements: Party A and
    Party B have their own complex and unique requirements and business
    processes, and need to design a flexible and fully scalable system
    to achieve efficient collaboration and interaction. Integrate and
    coordinate these processes to meet the different needs of both
    parties. The project involved a wide range of functions, including
    online course management, student management, sales operations,
    financial management, after-sales service, etc., and required the
    design of a flexible and scalable system architecture.

2.  Technology integration: To realize the functionality of the system,
    it is necessary to integrate the existing systems and services to
    ensure that the various modules can interact with each other
    seamlessly, which is a technical challenge.

3.  Permission management: The data involved in the system project needs
    to be strictly and meticulously managed and isolated to ensure that
    each different user can only access the data and functions within
    the scope of their authority.

4.  Project management: A detailed project plan and schedule needs to be
    developed to ensure that the project is delivered on time and
    achieves the desired results. As:

    -   System integration and communication: It is necessary to
        integrate with multiple third-party systems, such as video cloud
        service providers and data center providers, and to ensure
        effective communication and collaboration between different
        departments.

    -   Limited resources and time: The project has limited financial
        and human resources, and the deadline is tight, requiring proper
        planning and management of the project schedule to ensure
        on-time delivery.

5.  User training: Employees in all departments of Party A need to be
    trained in the use of the system to ensure that they are proficient
    in using the new system, providing ongoing technical support and
    maximizing its value.

In the face of these challenges, we recognize that the following core
issues need to be studied in depth:

1.  System design and architecture: How to design a flexible and
    scalable system architecture to support complex business
    requirements and function expansion?

2.  Permissions management and data isolation: How to design and
    implement a strict permissions management system and an effective
    data isolation strategy to ensure data security and integrity?

3.  System integration and communication: How do you integrate with
    multiple third-party systems and ensure effective communication and
    collaboration between departments?

4.  Project management and risk control: How to effectively manage
    project progress, identify and respond to project risks in a timely
    manner, and ensure smooth project delivery?

5.  User experience and technical support: How to design a user-friendly
    interface and provide effective technical support to ensure the ease
    of use and user satisfaction of the system?

While facing the above challenges and problems, we are also aware of the
following core questions, which have become the motivation and focus of
our research:

1.  How to design a flexible and comprehensive management system to meet
    the respective needs of Party A and Party B? We needed to deeply
    analyze the business processes and technical requirements of both
    parties to design a system that would meet existing requirements and
    be scalable.

2.  How do you seamlessly integrate existing systems and services? We
    need to study and select the appropriate integration solution to
    ensure that the various modules can interact with each other stably
    and reliably.

3.  How to design and implement a detailed permission management
    mechanism?

# 4. Research Objectives and Problem Statement

## 3. Key challenges of the project

-   In the project, we will face several key challenges, including
    requirements management, system architecture design, integration and
    communication, and project management. In particular, it is
    important to ensure the security and scalability of the system while
    delivering within a limited timeframe.

# 6. Needs analysis and customization functions

The content of connecting the requirements of Party A and Party B covers
many aspects of the system, which requires detailed analysis and design
of customized functions.

The following is the content of the requirements of Party B and Party A:

## 1. Online course management

-   Use Polyv SDK to connect with Polyv video cloud service providers to
    provide live streaming and on-demand online courses, and integrate
    Polyv Chat SDK chat rooms into the front page.

-   Reference and initialize the Polyv SDK and Polyv Chat SDK, make sure
    you have Polyv\'s account information, and initialize with the
    correct key and ID.

-   Create a chat room when the page loads and join users to that chat
    room.

-   Use the **setInterval()** function to implement an asynchronous
    polling request to get a message in the chat room.

-   Implement recommendations for introductory details, comment centers,
    and related courses.

-   Provide product management functions, including courses, books,
    companion classes, mock exams, etc.

-   Party B uses Infinitus Classification to handle the classification
    of back-end products and courses.

-   Provide banner management, that is, record the banner advertising
    information displayed on the website or application for the
    promotion of courses and products, including the following
    information: (1) Banner category: the category to which the
    advertisement belongs. (2) Banner position: the location information
    of the advertisement, including the location name and the number of
    contents. (3) Headline: The title of the advertisement. (4) Address:
    The link address that the ad redirects after clicking. (5) Course
    ID: The associated course ID, if applicable. (6) Image (PC):
    Advertising image used for PC display. (7) Images (WAP): Advertising
    images used for mobile display. (8) Sort ID: The order in which the
    ads are displayed. (9) Display status: The display status of the
    advertisement, such as visible or hidden.

## 2. Integration of payment features

> Party B uses the SDKs of Alipay and WeChat Pay to provide the payment
> function of the front desk. (1) The front-end sends the payment
> request to the back-end asynchronously or by other means. (2) After
> receiving the payment request, the backend uses the SDK of Alipay and
> WeChat Pay to perform payment operations. (3) The backend returns the
> payment result to the frontend. (4) The front-end will process
> accordingly according to the payment result, such as jumping to the
> payment success page or displaying a payment failure prompt. At the
> same time, a transaction record management table is established to
> avoid generating multiple rounds of transaction information. To avoid
> multiple transaction information records, the following methods can be
> used: (1) Generate a unique order number: Generate a unique order
> number each time a user initiates a payment request. An order number
> can be generated using a timestamp in combination with user
> information or other unique identifiers. This ensures that each
> transaction has a unique identifier and avoids duplicate records. (2)
> Limit duplicate requests: When processing the interface on the server
> side, the processed order number can be recorded, and when the
> repeated request is received, the existing transaction information can
> be directly returned instead of reprocessing. This can be done by
> recording the processed order number in the database or by saving the
> processed order number in memory. (3) Use the transaction status
> notification provided by Alipay and WeChat: Alipay and WeChat Pay will
> send a notification to the merchant\'s server when the transaction
> status changes, informing them of the transaction status change. You
> can update the status of a transaction when you receive a notification
> and avoid having to poll multiple times to query the status of a
> transaction. (4) Set a reasonable timeout mechanism: After initiating
> a payment request, set a reasonable timeout period, and if the payment
> result is not notified within that time, the user can consider
> re-querying the transaction status or prompting the user to pay the
> timeout. (5) The establishment of a transaction record management
> intermediate table is one of the effective ways to manage transaction
> information, which can avoid generating transaction information that
> is polled multiple times. Create a transaction record table in the
> database to record information about each transaction, including the
> order number, transaction status, transaction amount, etc. With this
> table, you can do the following:
>
> -   Record transaction information: Whenever a user initiates a payment
>     request, insert a record into the transaction history table,
>     containing information such as order number, transaction status,
>     etc.
>
> -   Query transaction status: When you need to query the status of a
>     transaction, you can directly query the record of the corresponding
>     order number in the transaction record table, instead of querying
>     the transaction status with the payment platform through rounding
>     multiple times.
>
> -   Update transaction status: When you receive a payment result
>     notification from the payment platform, you can directly update the
>     transaction status of the corresponding order number in the
>     transaction record table without the need to check or update it
>     again.
>
> -   Avoid duplicate records: Before inserting transactions, you can
>     check that records with the same order number already exist in the
>     database to avoid duplicate records.
